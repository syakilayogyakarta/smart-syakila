- Use clean, simple icons relevant to attendance and savings features. Consider outlined icons for a modern look.
- Maintain a clean and spacious layout with clear sections and intuitive navigation. Use consistent spacing and alignment.
- Incorporate subtle animations for state transitions (e.g., saving, loading) to enhance user experience without being distracting.
